# Although a domain extension (e.g. ':wasConductedBy') is not defined by PROV-O,
# the relation between a surgery and an agent can still be qualified
# by reusing prov:Influence and one of its three subclasses 
# (depending on the type of the influencing object):
# AgentInfluence, EntityInfluence, and ActivityInfluence.
