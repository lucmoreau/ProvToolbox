     * <p>Interface for PROV attribute location.
     * <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/#concept-location">PROV-DM Definition for Location</a>:  A location can be an identifiable geographic place (ISO 19112),
     * but it can also be a non-geographic place such as a directory, row, or column. As such, there are numerous ways in which location can be expressed, such as by a
     * coordinate, address, landmark, and so forth. This document does not specify how to concretely express locations, but instead provide a mechanism to introduce locations,
     * by means of a reserved attribute.
     * <p>The attribute prov:location is an optional attribute of Entity, Activity, Agent, Usage, Generation, Invalidation, Start, and End.
     * The value associated with the attribute prov:location must be a PROV-DM Value, expected to denote a location.
     * <p>While the attribute prov:location is allowed for several PROV concepts, it may not make sense to use it in some cases. For example, an activity that describes the
     * relocation of an entity will have start and end locations, as well as every place in between those points.
