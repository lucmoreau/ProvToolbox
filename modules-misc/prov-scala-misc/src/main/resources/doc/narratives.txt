The option --description allows for a descriptor file to be saved. It contains a JSON dictionary with the following elements.

-   "theOrderedStatements": is a vector of statements as ordered by the constraints.  The contents is an JSON structure, not too very user friendly. Key properties include:
   - "id": the identifier of the statemet (used in property "theOrderStatementIds")
   - "kind" : a string describing the type of statement, e.g. "PROV_ACTIVITY",



- "theOrderStatementIds": is a vector of Identifiers. Each of them is a Qualified Name also represented as a dictionary with the following properties:

    - "prefix" : the prefix of the Qualified Name
    - "localPart" : the local part of the QUalified Name
    - "namespaceURI" : the Namespace URI denoted by the prefix
    - "uri" : the URI corresponding to that Qualified Name


- "idx": an index of all event identifiers (statements of type "PROV_GENERATION", "PROV_INVALIDATION", "PROV_START", "PROV_END").
   All statements without id in the original document are given a unique id with prefix https://openprovenance.org/nlg#.
   PROV-CONSTRAINTS also infers generation/invalidation/start/end events, if they do not exist already, with prefix
      http://openprovenance.org/validation/4a8204cd-7825-4a71-9e71-411b2d936fb2# with a new  UUID for each validated document.


- "evt": an table mapping uri ids to statements.
The contents is an JSON structure, not too very user friendly. Key properties include:
   - "id": the identifier of the statemet (used in property "theOrderStatementIds")
   - "kind" : a string describing the type of statement, e.g. "PROV_START",  "PROV_END, ...


- ""order": contains a linearlisation of events, denoted by their number
