### The process during which the chart was created, from loading the data to the software, to process the data and plot the chart.
### Additional metadata was recorded, like when it started (before the usage), ended (after the generation of the chart) and who was associated with it.

   a prov:Activity;
   prov:wasAssociatedWith :derek;
   prov:startedAtTime "2012-04-03T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime;
   prov:endedAtTime "2012-04-03T00:00:10Z"^^xsd:dateTime;
.

### The final chart was plotted

:plot_the_chart
   a prov:Generation, prov:InstantaneousEvent;
   prov:atTime "2012-04-03T00:00:01Z"^^xsd:dateTime;

### The data was getting used to create the chart
